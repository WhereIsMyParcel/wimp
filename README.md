# Wimp
Wimp is an advanced parcel tracking system based on World Wind platform. WIMP is designed to work with shipping companies(to collect shipping data) and private users (customers) to provide a detailed report of the shipment in progress with a powerful user-friendly interface and the interactive World Wind's globe that can help to understand the actual shipping status with the latest information obtained from the database.  New information about the shipping status is managed by a Web Service that automatically updates the shipment's location in World Wind.  WIMP works with all typical platforms (mobile devices included) having an internet connection.
